# `fieldcompare` 0.1.4

## Features

- __I/O__: output capabilities for tabular and mesh field data was added. The former is written into `.csv` files, while for the latter a writer for the `.vtu` file format was added.
- __FieldData__: The `FieldData` protocol was enhanced by a `diff_to` function that computes the difference to given data. That is, `my_field_data.diff_to(reference)` returns a `FieldData` object that contains the differences `reference_${FIELD} - my_field_data_${FIELD}`.
Both `MeshFields` and `TabularFields` have been enhanced by corresponding implementations. An example for computing and writing the diff between to `FieldData` instances may look like this:
```py
from fieldcompare.io import write, read_field_data
from fieldcompare.mesh import sort

source = read_field_data("../test/data/test_mesh.vtu")
reference = read_field_data("../test/data/test_mesh_permutated_perturbed.vtu")
# sorting is NOT done implicitly, so we do it manually here since a diff can
# only be computed on (fuzzy-)equal meshes (and the two used here are not equal)
diff = sort(source).diff(sort(reference))
write(diff, "diff_file")
```
- __CLI__: The cli (both `file` and `dir` mode) was enhanced to take a `--diff` flag. If used, the difference between the fields for each pair of compared files is written to disk next to the source fields file (with prefix `diff_`).
